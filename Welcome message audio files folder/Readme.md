# Welcome Message â€“ Statewise Audio Prompts

This folder contains pre-recorded welcome message audio files tailored for various states. These prompts are designed to greet customers when they first connect to the contact center, providing a localized and personalized experience based on the caller's region.

Each audio file corresponds to a specific state and can be used in the initial greeting block of your Amazon Connect contact flow. These messages help set the tone for the interaction and ensure customers feel acknowledged and guided from the start.

To use these prompts, upload the desired audio file to Amazon Connect under **Routing > Prompts**, and reference it in the **Play Prompt** block at the beginning of your contact flow.
